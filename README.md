# UnityPlayground

This repository contains my practice files to test out new methods of implementing features.

- Using different methods to implement movement. I.e input system using unity events, c# events and input manager.

- Using assets from asset store to make a 3D world.

- Using maximo to download and test different ways of animations.

- More to come.....
